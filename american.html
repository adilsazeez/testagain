    <h2>Phenomenal Woman</h2>
    <p> Pretty women wonder where my secret lies. <br>
        I’m not cute or built to suit a fashion model’s size <br>   
        But when I start to tell them, <br>
        They think I’m telling lies. <br>
        I say, <br>
        It’s in the reach of my arms, <br>
        The span of my hips, <br>   
        The stride of my step,   <br>
        The curl of my lips.   <br>
        I’m a woman <br>
        Phenomenally. <br>
        Phenomenal woman, <br>  
        That’s me. <br>
        I walk into a room <br>
        Just as cool as you please, <br>   
        And to a man, <br>
        The fellows stand or <br>
        Fall down on their knees. <br>   
        Then they swarm around me, <br>
        A hive of honey bees.   <br>
        I say, <br>
        It’s the fire in my eyes, <br>   
        And the flash of my teeth,   <br>
        The swing in my waist,   <br>
        And the joy in my feet.   <br>
        I’m a woman <br>
        Phenomenally. <br>
        <br>
        Phenomenal woman, <br>
        That’s me. <br>
        <br>
        Men themselves have wondered   <br>
        What they see in me. <br>
        They try so much <br>
        But they can’t touch <br>
        My inner mystery. <br>
        When I try to show them, <br>   
        They say they still can’t see. <br>   
        I say, <br>
        It’s in the arch of my back, <br>   
        The sun of my smile, <br>
        The ride of my breasts, <br>
        The grace of my style. <br>
        I’m a woman <br>
        Phenomenally. <br>
        Phenomenal woman, <br>
        That’s me. <br>
        <br>
        Now you understand <br>
        Just why my head’s not bowed. <br>   
        I don’t shout or jump about <br>
        Or have to talk real loud. <br>   
        When you see me passing, <br>
        It ought to make you proud. <br>
        I say, <br>
        It’s in the click of my heels, <br>   
        The bend of my hair, <br>
        the palm of my hand,   <br>
        The need for my care.   <br>
        ’Cause I’m a woman <br>
        Phenomenally. <br>
        Phenomenal woman, <br>
        That’s me.<br></p>
