    "Linked List is a linear data structure.A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a \n",

    "### What is a Doubly Linked List?\n",
    "Doubly Linked List is a variation of Linked list in which navigation is possible in both ways, either forward and backward easily as compared to Single Linked List.It contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.\n",

    "<img src=\"1.png\">\n",
    "                               \n",
    "### What are the features of Doubly Linked list?\n",
    "Following is the features of doubly linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Doubly Linked List contains a link element called first and last.\n",
    "2. Each link carries a data field(s) and two link fields called next and prev.\n",
    "3. Each link is linked with its next link using its next link.\n",
    "4. Each link is linked with its previous link using its previous link.\n",
    "5. The last link carries a link as null to mark the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the advantages of Doubly Linked List over Single Linked List?\n",
    "1. A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction.\n",
    "2. The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to be deleted is given.\n",
    "3. We can quickly insert a new node before a given node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the disadvantages of Doubly Linked List over Single Linked List?\n",
    "1. Every node of DLL Require extra space for an previous pointer. It is possible to implement DLL with single pointer though (See this and this).\n",
    "2. All operations require an extra pointer previous to be maintained. For example, in insertion, we need to modify previous pointers together with next pointers. For example in following functions for insertions at different positions, we need 1 or 2 extra steps to set previous pointer."
